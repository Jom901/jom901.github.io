My League of legend team's website. I had to solve a major problem involving the league of legends API and my API key. I wouldn't like for people to pick up my league of legends API key off my github, so I made an applet on heroku that fetches data for me. A type of middleman applet using flask to do some data handling on the server side with the JSON acquired from the league of legends API.

This page is also fully responsive. I wanted to keep an original, non-commercial, design to further individualize my team's status in the LoLPR community. I doubt I'll be setting any trends but I like how it looks.
